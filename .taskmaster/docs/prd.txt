# Taskmaster UI - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview
Taskmaster UI is an open-source web-based graphical interface for the Task Master CLI tool. It provides a modern, intuitive kanban board interface for managing tasks and subtasks, making it easier for teams and individuals to visualize and manage their project workflows.

## Vision Statement
To create the most intuitive and powerful web-based UI for Task Master, enabling developers to visually manage their AI-powered task workflows with drag-and-drop simplicity while maintaining full compatibility with the CLI tool.

## Target Audience
- Individual developers using Task Master for project management
- Small to medium development teams
- Open source contributors
- Anyone who prefers visual task management over CLI

## Core Features

### 1. Kanban Board Interface
- Multiple columns representing task states: "Pending", "In Progress", "Review", "Done", "Blocked", "Deferred", "Cancelled"
- Visual task cards showing:
  - Task ID and title
  - Description preview
  - Priority indicators (high/medium/low)
  - Dependency indicators
  - Subtask progress (e.g., 3/5 subtasks complete)
  - Status badge
- Drag and drop functionality to move tasks between states
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### 2. Task Management
- View detailed task information in modal/sidebar
- Edit task title, description, details, and test strategy
- Add/remove/edit subtasks
- Manage task dependencies with visual indicators
- Expand tasks to create subtasks
- Real-time sync with Task Master CLI

### 3. Project Views
- Kanban board view (default)
- List view with sortable columns
- Timeline/Gantt view (future feature)
- Filter tasks by:
  - Status
  - Priority
  - Tags
  - Dependencies
  - Search terms

### 4. Task Master Integration
- Real-time file system monitoring for tasks.json changes
- Execute Task Master commands from UI:
  - Parse PRD
  - Generate tasks
  - Expand tasks
  - Research tasks
  - Next task recommendations
- Display complexity analysis reports
- Support for multiple tags/contexts

### 5. Collaboration Features
- Real-time updates when tasks.json changes
- Activity log showing recent changes
- Export board state as image/PDF
- Share read-only board links (future feature)

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- Next.js 15+ with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Shadcn/ui for component library
- React DnD or dnd-kit for drag and drop
- Zustand or Redux Toolkit for state management
- React Query for data fetching
- Framer Motion for animations

### Backend
- Next.js API routes
- File system watcher for tasks.json monitoring
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Task Master CLI integration via child processes
- SQLite for caching and performance (optional)

### Development
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Jest and React Testing Library for tests
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Vercel for deployment
- Comprehensive documentation
- Docker support

## User Interface Design

### Layout
- Clean, modern interface with dark/light mode support
- Collapsible sidebar with:
  - Project selector
  - Quick filters
  - Tag switcher
  - Recent activity
- Top navigation with:
  - Search bar
  - View switcher
  - Settings
  - Help/documentation links

### Visual Design
- Consistent with Task Master branding
- Accessible color scheme
- Clear typography hierarchy
- Intuitive icons and visual cues
- Loading states and error handling
- Empty states with helpful prompts

## API Design

### REST API Endpoints
- GET /api/tasks - List all tasks
- GET /api/tasks/:id - Get specific task
- PUT /api/tasks/:id - Update task
- POST /api/tasks - Create new task
- DELETE /api/tasks/:id - Delete task
- POST /api/commands - Execute Task Master commands
- GET /api/tags - List tags
- GET /api/complexity-report - Get complexity analysis

### WebSocket Events
- task:created
- task:updated
- task:deleted
- task:moved
- file:changed

## Security Considerations
- Local-first architecture (no cloud storage by default)
- Optional authentication for shared instances
- Safe command execution with validation
- XSS and CSRF protection
- Rate limiting for API endpoints

## Performance Requirements
- Initial load time < 3 seconds
- Smooth drag and drop (60fps)
- Handle 1000+ tasks without lag
- Efficient file watching
- Optimized re-renders

## Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast mode
- Focus indicators

## Open Source Requirements
- MIT License
- Contributing guidelines
- Code of conduct
- Issue templates
- PR templates
- Comprehensive README
- API documentation
- User guide

## Success Metrics
- GitHub stars and forks
- Active contributors
- Issue resolution time
- User satisfaction (via surveys)
- Performance benchmarks
- Accessibility audit scores

## Future Enhancements
- Cloud sync and collaboration
- Mobile apps (React Native)
- VS Code extension integration
- AI-powered task suggestions
- Time tracking
- Burndown charts
- Integration with other tools (Jira, GitHub Issues)
- Custom themes and plugins
